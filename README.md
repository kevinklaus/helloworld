First repository. Learning to git

Hey!
I am Kevin, 22 y/o and am just now finding out how git works!
I study at the HTW University of Applied Sciences in the field of Media and Computing.
Since it is an international Program some of my courses are held in English.
Lately I have really enjoyed the course in Image Processing!
